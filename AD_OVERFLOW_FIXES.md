# Ad Overflow Fixes

## Problem
The ads were overflowing their designated containers, causing layout issues where ad content would extend beyond the intended ad boxes.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Overflow Containment**: The `.ad-container` and `.ad-content` elements didn't have `overflow: hidden` properties
2. **No Box-sizing Control**: Ad content wasn't respecting container boundaries due to missing `box-sizing: border-box`
3. **External Script Injection**: The external ad script from `chillimagepublisher.com` was injecting content without size constraints
4. **Missing CSS Containment**: Modern CSS containment properties weren't being used to isolate ad content
5. **Iframe Size Issues**: Dynamically injected iframes weren't being forced to respect container dimensions

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. AdBanner Component Updates (`src/components/AdBanner.astro`)

**Added to `.ad-banner`:**
- `overflow: hidden` - Prevents banner from overflowing
- `contain: layout style` - Isolates layout calculations

**Added to `.ad-container`:**
- `overflow: hidden` - Strict container boundary enforcement
- `box-sizing: border-box` - Ensures padding/borders are included in dimensions
- `contain: layout style paint` - Full containment isolation
- `position: relative` - Establishes containing block for absolute positioning

**Added to `.ad-content`:**
- `max-width: 300px` and `max-height: 250px` - Hard size limits
- `overflow: hidden` - Prevents content overflow
- `box-sizing: border-box` - Proper box model
- `contain: layout style paint` - Complete containment
- `position: relative` - Positioning context

**Universal Ad Content Rules:**
```css
.ad-content * {
  max-width: 100% !important;
  max-height: 100% !important;
  box-sizing: border-box !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
}
```

**Iframe-Specific Rules:**
```css
.ad-content iframe {
  width: 300px !important;
  height: 250px !important;
  max-width: 300px !important;
  max-height: 250px !important;
  border: none !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
}
```

### 2. Global CSS Updates (`src/styles/global.css`)

**Global Ad Containment Rules:**
- Force all ad-related elements to respect boundaries
- Specific targeting of ad network elements
- Dynamic content injection protection
- Mobile-responsive size constraints

**Key Selectors:**
- `[id^="ad-"]` - Targets elements with IDs starting with "ad-"
- `[class*="ad-"]` - Targets elements with classes containing "ad"
- `script[src*="chillimagepublisher.com"] + *` - Targets content injected after ad scripts

## Technical Benefits

1. **CSS Containment**: Using `contain: layout style paint` isolates ad rendering from the rest of the page
2. **Overflow Control**: Multiple layers of `overflow: hidden` ensure no content escapes
3. **Box Model Consistency**: `box-sizing: border-box` ensures predictable sizing
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-specific rules maintain containment on smaller screens
5. **Dynamic Content Protection**: Rules that catch dynamically injected content

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Desktop Testing**: Verify ads stay within 320px × 250px bounds
2. **Mobile Testing**: Confirm ads respect 280px × 200px mobile constraints
3. **Network Variations**: Test with different ad networks and content types
4. **Dynamic Loading**: Verify containment works with lazy-loaded ads
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Test across different browsers for CSS containment support

## Fallback Considerations

- CSS containment has good modern browser support
- `overflow: hidden` provides fallback for older browsers
- `!important` declarations ensure priority over injected styles
- Multiple selector approaches catch various ad injection methods

## Monitoring

Watch for:
- Ads still overflowing on specific devices/browsers
- Performance impact from CSS containment
- Ad network compatibility issues
- Mobile viewport issues

The fixes should resolve the ad overflow issues while maintaining ad functionality and performance.
