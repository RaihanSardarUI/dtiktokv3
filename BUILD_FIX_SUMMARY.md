# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: The build was failing because npm dependencies were not properly installed in the environment.
**Error**: `sh: 1: astro: not found`
**Solution**: Ran `npm install` to install all required dependencies from package.json.

### 2. Build Output Directory
**Problem**: The original deployment logs showed "Output directory 'dist' not found" error.
**Solution**: After installing dependencies, the `npm run build` command successfully created the `dist` directory with all necessary files.

### 3. Experimental Flag Warning
**Problem**: The original logs showed a warning about invalid experimental features.
**Solution**: This appears to have been resolved automatically. No experimental flags were found in the current configuration.

## Current Status
✅ **Build Successful**: The `npm run build` command now completes successfully
✅ **Output Directory**: The `dist` directory is created with all required files
✅ **Cloudflare Compatibility**: The build output includes `_worker.js` and `_routes.json` files required for Cloudflare Pages

## Build Output Structure
```
dist/
├── _astro/                 # Astro build assets
├── _worker.js/            # Cloudflare Worker files
│   ├── chunks/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── index.js
├── _routes.json           # Cloudflare routing configuration
├── favicon/               # Favicon files
├── optimized/             # Optimized assets
├── robots.txt             # SEO file
└── [various image files]  # Static assets
```

## Next Steps
The build is now working correctly and should deploy successfully to Cloudflare Pages. The wrangler.toml configuration is properly set to use the `dist` directory as the build output.
